## Project Overview

This is a **Gemini-style conversational AI chat frontend clone** built using **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **Redux Toolkit**, **React Hook Form**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app simulates an OTP login, chatroom management, AI messaging with typing indicators, image upload, infinite scroll, and various UX features.

The project demonstrates practical knowledge of modern React/Next.js, state management, form validation, accessibility, and responsive UI design.

Known Limitations & Future Improvements
Form validation uses basic React Hook Form rules; integration with Zod schemas is planned for enhanced validation.

Dark Mode toggle is functional but can be polished further for better UX.

Accessibility improvements such as enhanced keyboard navigation and ARIA roles are planned.

Infinite scroll optimization with event throttling/debouncing.

Image upload currently supports preview but lacks removal or editing before sending.
